# Mindustry ArkTik
A Java Mindustry mod template that works on Android and PC. The Kotlin version of this mod can be seen [here](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryKotlinModTemplate).

## Building for Desktop Testing

1. Install JDK **17**.
2. Run `gradlew jar` [1].
3. Your mod jar will be in the `build/libs` directory. **Only use this version for testing on desktop. It will not work with Android.**
To build an Android-compatible version, you need the Android SDK. You can either let Github Actions handle this, or set it up yourself. See steps below.
